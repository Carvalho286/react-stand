# react-stand

In this project, using MongoDB ``localhost`` we have a manager for a stand that let users make reservations in a specific car and a specific date.
Also there's a Admin Menu with the CRUD of the Cars, the Users and the Reservations

<br />

<h3>To Start Project</h3>
<br />
<br />
On each folder (BackEnd and FrontEnd) run `` npm install `` command to install the necessary packages to run the project.
<br />
After that just run the 2 `` .bat `` files to start each server. Personally recommend start the BackEnd first.
